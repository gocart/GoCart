Additional Features
===================
GoCart for Indian ECommerce Developers adds specific Features that are interesting for India.
For Example Indian Payment Gateways, Indian Shipping Modules, etc., 

If any of the feature we have developed can be used at a global level then we raise a pull request to the Main GoCart/GoCart repository.

Currently we have developed the following Features.


1) Reply To Email Address
2) Save Shipping/Billing Address.
3) Social Login
4) Gvatar Image

1) Reply To Email Address
----------------------
When the GoCart is installing we ask the User to provide one more Email ID which will be used as Reply_To Email.
ie., we prepare to send automatic emails through a email id called "noreply@abc.com" and when the customer tries to reply to the automatic email, the reply will go the reply_to email id.

2) Save Shipping/Billing Address
--------------------------------
In the Checkout Page when the customer is adding new Shipping or Billing Address he gets an option to save it from there it self.

3) Social Login
---------------
Hurray! Customer can now Login using Yahoo or Google.

4) Gvatar Image
---------------
User's Gvatar Image is shown in the My Account Page
